## Issues

- `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` warnings
- wrong types for FontAwesome icons, can't use
- `findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode` warnings from react-select-async-paginate
- auto-imports are not working most of the time for react-bootstrap
- prettier is not enforcing a quote style?
